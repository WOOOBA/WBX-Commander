## Getting Started

**DO NOT RUN WBX COMMANDER AS ROOT**

### Create a user

1. Use the adduser command to add a new user to your system. Be sure to replace username with the user that you want to create.

	`adduser username`

2. Set and confirm the new user's password at the prompt. A strong password is highly recommended!

3. Follow the prompts to set the new user's information. It is fine to accept the defaults to leave all of this information blank.

4. Use the usermod command to add the user to the sudo group.

	`usermod -aG sudo username`
	
	Again replacing username with the name used in step #1

5. Switch to the new user

	`su - username`
